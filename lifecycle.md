Example Form
--> App: Application Component
  --> coupled Dispatcher: AppDispatcher
  --> child: Form
    --> children: Input('name'), Textarea('description'), Button 
    --> coupled Dispatcher: FormDispatcher with Parent AppDispatcher

--> (User) enters "Xing" in Input
  --> Input.validate() is called --> success
  --> Form.handleUpdate() is called by Input.validate()
  --> Form triggers FormDispatcher.action({type: FormDispatcher.UPDATE, name: 'Xing'})
  --> FormDispatcher calls a registered reducer FormDispatcher.handleUpdate(prev, action)
  --> FormDispatcher updates its FormDispatcherStore
  --> FormDispatcherStore triggers its UPDATE event
  --> Forms state reacts and updates its state according to FormDispatcherStore
  --> Repaint by React (e.g. marking the field as valid)

--> (User) clicks submit
  --> Button.handleClick() is called
  --> Form.handleSubmit() is called
  --> Form triggers FormDispatcher.action({type: FormDispatcher.SUBMIT})
  --> FormDispatcher calls a registered reducer FormDispatcher.handleSubmit(prev, action)
  --> handleSubmit() triggers AppDispatcher.action({type: AppDispatcher.INPUT, name: 'Xing', description:''})
  --> AppDispatcher calls a registered reducer AppDispatcher.handleInput(prev, action)
  --> handleInput() posts the result to the backend (XHR)
  --> the response callback (Promise) triggers AppDispatcher.action({type: AppDispatcher.SAVE_RESPONSE, success: false, message: 'name already exists'})
  --> AppDispatcher calls a registered reducer AppDispatcher.handleSave(prev, action)
  --> AppDispatcher updates its AppDispatcherStore
  --> AppDispatcherStore triggers its UPDATE event
  --> Apps state reacts and updates its state according to FormDispatcherStore
  --> Forms props get updated
  --> Repaint by React (e.g. showing a message box)
