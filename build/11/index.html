    <p>That was a very basic introduction to React, the view layer of a
      possible frontend application. But several more aspects must be
      considered for that.</p>
    <!-- Content goes here -->
    <p>To name but a few:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>How can the <strong>composition of Components</strong>
        change over time (e.g. opening a lightbox, adding a
        success-message on top)?<br>
        This should actually be easy because <code>render()</code> is
        called everytime something changes and therefore can return
        wht you want it to return
      </li>
      <li>How should we <strong>load code on demand</strong>?<br>
        As soon as the user navigates to a different
        page / xing application, it is  most likely that
        styles and code must be requested from the server.
        I'm pretty sure that we don't want to deliver
        the whole frontend on every fresh request.</li>
      <li>What about <strong>navigation</strong>?
        What happens when a user moves e.g. from the start
        page to his profile?
        <ul>
          <li>Fresh components (js) and styles (css) must be
            fetched (with techniques from (2))</li>
          <li>The central area must display a different set
            of components change (with techniques from (1))</li>
            fetched (with techniques from (2))</li>
          <li>The url in the browser must change</li>
          <li>The history of the browser must be updated
            (to get browser back to work properly)</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ol>
